# ThingsAI
### Using evolution to make an image out of things!

### Requirements
Most of the requirements come with python or will already be installed in most conda environments, however, all non-standard ones are listed below.
```
pillow
scipy
numpy
```

### Usage
1. Create a folder called "Things" and fill it with the images you want to use to create the target image
2. Run things2pickle.py to create an index of all the images. This can be run again to update the index at any time
3. Put the target image in the folder and give it the name "target.png"
4. Run thingsAI.py
